I had never traveled solo before and never traveled outside india.
So when i decided to travel I had zero information.
First step was to decide where to travel. I read few blogs and decided on south east asia
for following reasons-
1. cheap
2. very popular backpacking trail. Easy to meet other travelers and local people.

Resources for planning-
Funky guides had really good and concise information and it helped me most to decide the places and routes.
lonely planet
wikitravel - i used this during the journey to find places to stay ann eat. you can also download
wikivoyage app.
hostelworld, hostelbooker and agoda mobile app.
maps.me for offline access.

Visa
Getting visa is easy but there is a lack of straight forward information over the internet regarding
documents required.
You only need a passport and visa fees.
But airlines require more documents especially flight ticket out of country. I did not had a ticket out of laos
and had to book it on the airport to board the flight.
I suggest book a flight ticket out of first country and cancel it later and travel overland.

Money
Definitely it is the most important thing. I read that carrying multiple cards and getting travel cards which
has lower transaction fee is a good option. I start searching for the right card and after getting frustated
because of no clear information and lack of time i did not get any card other than my hdfc debit card which i
use in india. Bookmyforex was the best option which i found but still i was disappointed by their service.

So just on the day of boarding flight from Kolkata i got US$ curreny notes worth 50000 RS.
US$ is accepted everywhere, can exchange it everywhere.
I mostly used us$ for visa fees and then for places like where withdrawing was not a good option. In
every withdrawl i got charged 200-300 rs twice.

Journey-
I started my journey in Bangkok. I had read few novels about Bangkok, watched Beach movie
and so was very excited about it and expected it to be crazy & intense. This was the only city
where i had booked my accomodation in advance. I stayed in Born free hostel near Khao San Road which
is very touristy and filled with backpackers.

I walked in the nearby area and saw awesome street food but felt weird to even talk to them and order.
I also felt very lonely here. In the evening I met two girls in the hostel(polish and german) and we went out
to khao san road.

There are so many places in Bangkok to see. I wanted to see the red light areas but felt afraid to go there
alone.
