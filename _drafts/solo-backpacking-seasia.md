title: Solo Backpacking across South East Asia for 2 months.
comments: True
---

I had never traveled solo before and never traveled outside India, so when i decided to travel I had no clue on how to do it.
First step was to decide where to travel. After reading few blogs I decided on south east Asia because it is cheap, popular and easy backpacking trail.

### Resources for planning

I started looking for books and found [Funky guides](https://www.amazon.com/Backpackers-Guide-Southeast-Asia-2016-ebook/dp/B00OY2QHX4) for backpacking to SE Asia. I liked this book and it helped me decide on the countries and routes.

I used lonely planet during the journey to find more information about particular places.

[Wikitravel](wikitravel.com) - I used this during the journey to find places to stay and eat. You can also download the wikivoyage mobile app.

[Travelfish](travelfish.org) - This has articles about the places and are very well written.

Hostelworld, Hostelbooker and agoda mobile apps for finding places to stay.

Use maps.me and download the countries map to use it offline.

### Visa
Getting visa is a simple process for these countries but there is a lack of proper information over the Internet especially regarding the documents required.

##### Thailand
15 days visa on arrival for Indian passport holders in Bangkok airport. Officialy you only need valid passport, photograph and 1000 Baht. But airlines ask for a flight ticket out of country. And in Kolkata airport they also asked me for a hotel booking, which I had for only first night in Bangkok.

##### Laos
30 days visa on arrival for Indian passport holders at international airport and popular border crossings.
I took a Lao airlines flight from Bangkok and they asked me for a flight ticket out of Laos, which I had to book in the airport to board the flight.

##### Vietnam
No visa on arrival. I got 30 days visa from Vietnamese embassy in Luang Prabang, Laos for 40$.

I suggest book a flight ticket out of first country and cancel it later and travel overland.

### Money
I read that carrying multiple cards and getting travel cards which
has lower transaction fee is a good option. I start searching for the right card and after getting frustated
because of no clear information and lack of time i did not get any card other than my hdfc debit card which i
use in india. Bookmyforex was the best option which i found but still i was disappointed by their service.

So just on the day of boarding flight from Kolkata i got US$ curreny notes worth 50000 RS.
US$ is accepted everywhere, can exchange it everywhere.
I mostly used us$ for visa fees and then for places like where withdrawing was not a good option. In
every withdrawl i got charged 200-300 rs twice.

## Journey
My plan was to spend 15 days in the south of Thailand then go to Laos and come back to Thailand and spend 15 days in the north. But I ended up going to Vietnam from Laos and skipped northen Thailand.

### Thailand
I started my journey in Bangkok. I had read few novels about Bangkok, watched Beach movie
and so was very excited about it and expected it to be crazy & intense. This was the only city
where i had booked my accomodation in advance. I stayed in Born free hostel near Khao San Road which
is very touristy and filled with backpackers.

I walked in the nearby area and saw awesome street food but felt weird to even talk to them and order.
I also felt very lonely here. In the evening I met two girls in the hostel(polish and german) and we went out
to khao san road.

There are so many places in Bangkok to see. I wanted to see the red light areas but felt afraid to go there
alone.

From Bangkok I took a train to Suratthani to go Koh Phangan Island.

I stayed 6 days here and then went to Krabi to go to koh phi phi which is on the other side of the country.

### Laos

From Bangkok I took a flight to go to Vientiane, capital city of Laos.
