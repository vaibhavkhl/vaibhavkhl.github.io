I worked with react for the first time when I was working with RecruiterBox.
There we were just using react as a view layer, plugging react components in BackboneJs views. Everything was great.

But recently I started working on a application which uses Redux and
all other tools in react ecosystem. I started learning and quickly got overwhelmed by
all the tools and libraries like babel, webpack, es6, flux, redux etc.

So apparently a lot of developers are facing this as Dan Abramov created a [flowchart](https://github.com/gaearon/react-makes-you-sad) to make you happy again.
Also checkout Pete Hunt's [guide](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto) to the ecosystem.

I hope this helps!
